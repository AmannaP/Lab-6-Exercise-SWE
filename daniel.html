            <h2>What is Software Engineering?</h2>
            <p>Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering approaches to the development of software. It goes beyond mere programming to encompass the entire software lifecycle, from conception and requirements gathering to design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.</p>

                <li><strong>Modularity:</strong> Breaking down complex systems into manageable, independent components.</li>
                <li><strong>Abstraction:</strong> Hiding complexity by representing features at a simplified level.</li>
                <li><strong>DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):</strong> Reducing repetition of code patterns to improve maintainability.</li>
                <li><strong>SOLID principles:</strong> Guidelines for creating more maintainable, understandable, and flexible software.</li>
                <li><strong>Continuous integration and delivery:</strong> Automating the build, test, and deployment processes.</li>

            <h2 class="section-title">The Software Development Lifecycle</h2>
            <p>The software development lifecycle (SDLC) provides a structured approach to development, typically including these phases:</p>
            
            <div class="phase">
                <h3>1. Requirements Analysis</h3>
                <p>Understanding what the software should do and the constraints it must operate within. This phase often involves stakeholder interviews, market research, and feasibility studies.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="phase">
                <h3>2. Design</h3>
                <p>Creating the architecture and detailed design of the software, including data structures, interfaces, and algorithms. Good design anticipates future needs and changes.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="phase">
                <h3>3. Implementation</h3>
                <p>Writing the actual code based on the design specifications. This phase often involves code reviews, pair programming, and adherence to coding standards.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="phase">
                <h3>4. Testing</h3>
                <p>Verifying that the software works as expected through unit tests, integration tests, system tests, and acceptance tests. Testing identifies bugs and ensures quality.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="phase">
                <h3>5. Deployment</h3>
                <p>Releasing the software to users, which may involve installation, configuration, and data migration strategies.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="phase">
                <h3>6. Maintenance</h3>
                <p>Updating the software to fix bugs, improve performance, or add new features. Maintenance often consumes the majority of a software's lifecycle.</p>


Lab 6 Exercise - Software Engineering (CS 415)

Overview
This repository contains our Lab 6 Exercise for CS 415: Software Engineering. The lab focuses on Git and GitHub workflows, including branching, merging, and collaborative development.

Project Description
The project is a basic static website that includes:

An index page (index.html) that serves as the homepage.

Personal members' pages contain things  (chika.html, daniel.html, dave.html, ewura.html) for each team member.

CSS files (index.css, chika.css, daniel.css, dave.css, ewura.css) to style individual pages.

Each team member created their own page and styled it using CSS before merging their changes into the main branch.
